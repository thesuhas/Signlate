# Signlate


## About

An App that converts Sign Language in video format to text. The application itself is made by using kivy (a python library for app development). A user can click a picture from the app, which is then fed to a CNN. This CNN then returns the sign to the App to be displayed.

## Basic Layout

The basic layout is as follows:<br><br>

The translation appears in the text box that says "Translation Comes here"
