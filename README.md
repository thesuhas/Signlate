# Signlate


## About

An App that converts Sign Language in video format to text. The application itself is made using kivy (a python framework for app development). A user can access camera to submit their video on the app, from which frames are captured at regular time intervals and fed to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This CNN then returns the letter corresponding to the sign to the App to be displayed to the user.

## Basic Layout
